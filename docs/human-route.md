# Human speedrun route: Part I, treasure + idol

*The Secret of Monkey Island* (1990, classic SCUMM), Part I "The Three Trials".
The segment runs from gaining control at the start of Part I until both the
treasure trial (dig up the T-shirt) and the idol trial (pick up the idol
underwater) are complete. Swordfighting/Carla is out of scope, but this document
records where the human route interleaves it.

All sources were accessed on **2026-10-04**.

## Summary

- **There is no glitchless category.** speedrun.com has Any%, Any% (Talkie),
  Swordmaster% and Demo for the classic game, and Any% and Special% for the
  Special Edition. Any% allows savestates, ScummVM-only speed benefits and
  "Credit Early". None of those tricks changes the action list for the treasure
  and idol trials, so the human trial route is glitch-free at the action level.
  The speed differences come from timing tricks (see §2.3).
- **Current route order** (2025 IL by saruya, 2026 WR by saruya):
  1. kitchen (pot, meat, fish)
  2. circus (money)
  3. petal
  4. map
  5. chicken
  6. Otis
  7. store (shovel, sword, mints)
  8. mansion #1 (gopher repellent)
  9. Otis (cake, file)
  10. mansion #2 (idol)
  11. underwater
  12. troll, then Smirk (swordfight only)
  13. forest dance, then dig
  14. insult fights, then Carla

  The idol trial is finished before the treasure trial in both runs. The 2019
  text guide dug the treasure after Carla instead. Newer runs dig it before the
  insult fights.
- **Counts (treasure + idol only, §4):** 22 player actions. 48 player-initiated
  room transitions from the Lookout (47 if the opening Esc skip is used), plus 3
  scripted transitions.

## 2. Category rules relevant to "glitchless"

### 2.1 What the rules say

- **No glitchless category exists.** Classic page categories: Any%, Any%
  (Talkie), Swordmaster%, Demo, and the IL "Beat the Sword Master" (SRC-GAME).
  Special Edition: Any% and Special% (SE). In 2017 aWay0fLife said the speed
  glitch is easy to activate, "is why I am not advocating for a 'glitchless'
  category" (F-SPEED).
- **Any% timing:** "Timing starts when the Lucasfilm Games logo is skipped and
  ends when the game fades to black after the final cut scene" (SRC-GAME).
- **Inputs:** remapping is allowed, but "one key press resulting in one game
  input only" (SRC-GAME).
- **Saves:** "Credit Early*, Saveless and Saves (Using save states) are all
  allowed" (SRC-GAME). Credit Early means you "opened the shopkeepers safe early
  in the run without knowing the code" (F-CREDIT).
- **ScummVM subcategory:** "Any speed benefits only possible in ScummVM are
  allowed". Music device: any except "No Music". Runs must use ScummVM 2.8 or
  later (SRC-GAME). Runners fix the ScummVM random seed: 2756848129 in the WR,
  102545962 for HYP and frozenspade (SRC-LB).
- **Game-level rules:** "Runs are timed in RTA", "require video evidence",
  "must be a single segment video" (SRC-GAME).
- **Special Edition:** Special% is "completed without ever switching to
  'Classic Graphics Mode'". SE Any% has no rules text (SE).

### 2.2 Text skip and cutscene skip

The rules do not mention `.` (skip one line) or Esc (skip a cutscene), and
neither is restricted. Every guide and every top run uses both:

- G19: "Press Esc or double click ... to [skip]", "skip dialogue by Pressing .
  (period)".
- F-RULES (2017): text speed "doesn't matter. You should be using Period (.)
  Key".
- G-CONV: Esc only sometimes skips whole conversation fragments. Clicking both
  mouse buttons together equals Esc.

### 2.3 Tricks in Part I and whether they change the trial action list

| Trick | Where | Changes the treasure/idol action list? | Against fast-mi `rules/glitchless.md` |
|---|---|---|---|
| Logo "speed glitch": Esc at the first sparkle of the Lucasfilm logo makes walking and animations faster for the whole run (G19, F-SPEED). G19 calls it "probably just a quirk". | Boot | No (timing only) | A timing exploit of engine behaviour, so it falls under banned item 2. It cannot be expressed as a sentence anyway. |
| Early door entry: entering "at the beginning of the door opening animation" (G19) | All doors | No | Pixel/timing input, so it is never modelled (banned item 4). |
| Cook timing: enter while the cook's "elbow is still visible" (G19). The cook always leaves about 10 s after the attempt (G19 notes). | Kitchen | No | Not modelled. The plan waits for the scripts. |
| Interrupting the plant pickup early (G19: risky, small gain) | Petal screen | No | Not modelled. |
| Shmoovement (repeated clicks while walking left/up, F-CONV) | Walking | No | Pixel input (banned item 4). |
| `.` / Esc skipping | Everywhere | No (removes waits). G19 dialogue numbers assume skipping. | Out of scope for v1 (not banned). |
| Credit Early: seeded safe combination plus a savestate before entering the store (F-SAFE, IL-CE). Safe pulls happen at the first store visit (WR 3:00). | Store | No. The note of credit is crew-only (Part I ending). | Save/load (banned item 3) and seed knowledge. |
| Invisible-stairs glitch at the safe (G19) | Store, after the trials | No (post-trials crew phase) | Engine glitch (banned item 2). |
| Item slide: monkey, oars and feather skips (G-SLIDE) | Part 3 only | No | n/a |
| Ctrl+W instant win (F-RULES) | Debug | n/a. Asked to be banned in 2017. Not named in the current rules text. | Banned item 1. |

Conclusion: the human treasure and idol action sequence below uses only
ordinary verb/object sentences and dialogue choices. Its speed advantage over a
literal replay comes from timing tricks and skips, not from different actions.

### 2.4 Version used by runners

| Run / guide | Version | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| G19 (2019) | DOS CD (icon inventory) | G19 "it'll show as flowers in the inventory"; F-CD "cd-rom version by default". |
| IL (saruya 2025) | DOS VGA floppy (12-verb UI, text inventory) | Frames (IL 0:06 onward). |
| WR (saruya 2026-08) | DOS CD (9-verb UI, icon inventory), ScummVM 2026.3.0 | Frames (WR 0:05 onward); SRC-LB. |
| HYP (2025-07, former WR) | EGA floppy, ScummVM 2.9.1 | SRC-LB comment. |

The Part I trial route was identical in the IL (VGA floppy) and the WR (CD) as
far as I inspected. The only difference is Credit Early in the WR. Version
differences that matter elsewhere:

- The Special Edition is slower and has a separate board. In SE, Carla never
  uses one insult (G-SW).
- EGA allows a map-teleport trick on Hook Isle (F-EGA, crew only).
- fast-mi uses the Mac v5 VGA release. No human runs on Mac were found.

## 3. Route

### 3.1 Conventions

- **[A]** marks a player action: one verb/object sentence, counted 1. "Talk to
  X" counts 1. Its dialogue picks are listed in-line and not counted as actions.
  A conversation that starts by itself on room entry counts 0 actions. Waiting
  is not an action.
- **[T]** marks a player-initiated room transition: walking through an exit,
  door or archway, or clicking a map destination. Entering the island map
  counts as one transition, and leaving it for a destination counts as another.
  Scrolling inside a wide room is not a transition.
- **[S]** marks a scripted transition: the game moves Guybrush during a
  cutscene. Listed but not counted.
- **Serves:** `T` treasure, `I` idol, `T+I` both, `$` money (needed for the map
  and shovel, so it counts toward `T+I`), `SW` swordfight only, `CREW` Part I
  crew phase only. Only `T`, `I`, `T+I` and `$` steps are counted in §4.
- **Dia:** dialogue option numbers from G19 (top option = 1). They assume `.`
  and Esc skipping as in G19.
- **Sources:** each step names its sources. **(inferred)** marks anything not
  directly stated or seen.
- **Rooms (my names):**
  - Lookout
  - Dock (SCUMM Bar exterior, wide)
  - Bar main room
  - Bar back room (fireplace, important-looking pirates)
  - Kitchen (includes the outside pier platform with the fish)
  - Island map
  - Clearing
  - Circus tent
  - Fork (forest entrance)
  - Petal screen
  - forest screens
  - X clearing
  - Low street (Citizen of Mêlée, Voodoo shop door)
  - Voodoo shop
  - High street (clock archway, jail, store)
  - Jail
  - Store
  - Trail (cliff path to the mansion)
  - Mansion exterior (poodles)
  - Mansion interior (foyer and stair hall, one wide room; inferred from
    camera snaps in IL)
  - Pier (the dock where Fester throws Guybrush)
  - Underwater

### 3.2 Steps

**Start.** Without skipping, control starts at the Lookout after the Lookout
conversation (AG: "walk down the path from the lookout point"). In every
speedrun, holding Esc through the intro skips it, and control starts with
Guybrush already on the Dock's cliff path (IL 0:02–0:03, WR 0:05). The
important-looking pirates are never talked to: G19 says "don't click on any
pirate", IL 0:18–0:21 shows no conversation, and WIKI says reporting the trials
is optional.

**SCUMM Bar kitchen**

1. [T] Lookout → Dock (walk down the cliff path). — T+I — AG. Skipped by the
   speedrun intro Esc (IL 0:03).
2. [A] Open door (SCUMM Bar). — T+I — G19, AG; IL 0:12–0:15 ("Open door").
3. [T] Dock → Bar main room. — T+I — G19; IL 0:18.
4. [T] Bar main room → Bar back room (walk right past the curtain). — T+I —
   AG; IL 0:18–0:21.
5. [A] Open door (kitchen). The cook comes out. Skip his line, wait about 10 s
   for him to leave (he is visible walking left at IL 0:35–0:37). — T+I — G19,
   AG; IL 0:21–0:37.
6. [T] Bar back room → Kitchen. — T+I — G19; IL 0:38.
7. [A] Open door (kitchen → outside pier platform, same room). — SW — AG; IL
   0:39 ("Open door").
8. [A] Step on the plank to launch the seagull, repeated (G19: twice; AG:
   three times). — SW — G19, AG; IL 0:40–0:43.
9. [A] Pick up fish. — SW (troll bribe) — G19, AG; IL 0:43–0:44 (fish in
   inventory).
10. [A] Pick up pot. — $ (circus helmet) — G19, AG; IL 0:45 ("Pick up", pot
    appears).
11. [A] Pick up hunk of meat. — I (poodles) — G19, AG; IL 0:46. G19: "Use Pot
    on Meat" picks up both in one action. IL uses two pickups.
12. [T] Kitchen → Bar back room. — T+I — IL 0:47–0:48.
13. [T] Bar back room → Bar main room. — T+I — IL 0:48–0:51.
14. [T] Bar main room → Dock. Esc skips the LeChuck cutscene. — T+I — G19; IL
    0:51–0:54.

**Circus (money)**

15. [T] Dock → Lookout (walk up the cliff path). — T+I — AG; IL 1:00–1:06.
16. [T] Lookout → Island map ("walk to path"). — T+I — AG; IL 1:06–1:09.
17. [T] Map → Clearing. — T+I — G19; IL 1:12–1:15.
18. [T] Clearing → Circus tent. — T+I — G19, AG; IL 1:18–1:21.
19. (auto-conversation, 0 actions) The Fettucini brothers argue. Dia: 1, then
    1, 2, with Esc skips (G19). AG: any option, then "OK, I'll do it", then
    claim to have a helmet. Options visible at IL 1:24. — $
20. [A] Give pot to Fettucini brothers. Cannon cutscene. Dia: 1 (G19). Receive
    **478 pieces of eight**. — $ — G19, AG; IL 1:27 ("that will work as a
    helmet"); WR 1:25 ("Give pot to Fettucini Brothers"). 478 visible in the IL
    inventory at 1:42.
21. [T] Circus tent → Clearing. — T+I — IL 1:39–1:42.
22. [T] Clearing → Map. — T+I — IL 1:45–1:48.

**Yellow petal**

23. [T] Map → Fork. — I — G19; IL 1:48–1:51.
24. [T] Fork → Petal screen (top exit; G19: "Go up (there are two exits, both
    lead to the same place)"). — I — G19, AG; IL 1:51–1:54.
25. [A] Pick up plants (yellow petal). — I — G19, AG; IL 1:54 ("Pick up
    plants").
26. [T] Petal screen → Fork. — I — IL 1:57–1:58 (inferred room identity: a
    forest screen without the petals, then the map).
27. [T] Fork → Map. — I — IL 1:59–2:00.
28. [T] Map → Village. The map "village" destination puts Guybrush directly on
    the Dock, not the Lookout. — T+I — IL 2:00–2:03 (observed).
29. [A] Use yellow petal with hunk of meat, giving meat with condiment. Do it
    while walking; it only has to happen before the poodles. — I — G19; IL
    2:06 (inventory shows "meat with condiment").

**Map, chicken, Otis #1**

30. [T] Dock → Low street (walk right along the Dock, through the archway). — T+I
    — AG; IL 2:09–2:21.
31. [A] Talk to Citizen of Mêlée. Dia: 4, Esc, 2. Buy the **map for 100**
    (478 → 378). — T — G19, G-CONV; AG gives the option wording; IL 2:23 ("Talk
    to Citizen of Mêlée"), 2:27 (378, map in inventory); WIKI price.
32. [A] Open door (Voodoo shop). — CREW — G19, AG; IL 2:27–2:30.
33. [T] Low street → Voodoo shop. — CREW — IL 2:31.
34. [A] Pick up chicken. — CREW (rubber chicken for Hook Isle) — G19, AG; IL
    2:32–2:33.
35. [A] Open door (leave). — CREW — AG; IL 2:35.
36. [T] Voodoo shop → Low street. — CREW — IL 2:36.
37. [T] Low street → High street (archway under the clock). — T+I — G19, AG;
    IL 2:36–2:42.
38. [T] High street → Jail (walk to doorway). — I — G19; IL 2:45–2:47.
39. [A] Talk to prisoner (Otis). Skip his line, then leave. — I — G19; IL 2:48
    ("Talk to prisoner"); WR 2:45. **Why it is needed is inferred**, probably
    to unlock the store's breath-mint option. See §5.
40. [T] Jail → High street. — I — IL 2:50.

**Store (shovel, mints; sword for SW)**

41. [A] Open door (store). — T+I — G19, AG; IL 2:53–2:56.
42. [T] High street → Store. — T+I — IL 2:57.
43. [A] Pick up shovel (upstairs near the safe). — T — G19, AG; IL 3:00–3:02.
44. [A] Pick up sword. — SW — G19, AG; IL 3:03–3:04 (sword in inventory by
    3:14).
45. [A] Talk to storekeeper. Dia: 3, 1, 1, 1, 1, 2 (G19 as corrected in
    F-STORE). The options visible at IL 3:09 are: ask about sword, ask about
    shovel, ask for a breath mint, browse. So 3 = **breath mint (1 piece of
    eight)**. Then 1, 1 = sword (**100**), 1, 1 = shovel (**75**), 2 = browse
    (mapping of the later numbers is inferred). — T+I (sword picks: SW) — G19,
    F-STORE; IL 3:05–3:13 (mints, sword, shovel in inventory at 3:14); WIKI
    prices. The treasure+idol-only version needs about 4 picks (mint, shovel,
    "I want it", browse); this is inferred.
    - Credit Early (WR only, CREW): pull/push the safe handle with the seeded
      combination before buying (WR 3:00 "Pull handle"; IL-CE 2:58–3:08, which
      shows the savestate dialog and then "nothing in here but this note").
    - Computed money after the store: 378 − 100 − 75 − 1 = **202**.
46. [T] Store → High street (door already open). — T+I — IL 3:15–3:16.

**Mansion #1 (gopher repellent)**

47. [T] High street → Trail (archway on the left). — I — AG; IL 3:17–3:21.
48. [T] Trail → Mansion exterior. — I — AG; IL 3:24–3:30.
49. [A] Use meat with condiment with poodles. They sleep for the rest of
    Part I; they are still asleep at IL 4:27. — I — G19, AG; IL 3:30–3:38.
50. [A] Open door (mansion front door). — I — G19, AG; IL 3:39.
51. [T] Mansion exterior → Mansion interior. — I — IL 3:42.
52. [A] Open door (the doors on the right of the foyer). Esc skips the
    idol-room cutscene. Guybrush receives **gopher repellent**; IL also shows
    staple remover, Manual of Style and wax lips added. — I — G19 ("Open door
    on right, SKIP cutscene, leave"), AG, WIKI; IL 3:42–3:45.
53. [T] Mansion interior → Mansion exterior (front door still open). — I — IL
    3:48–3:52.
54. [T] Mansion exterior → Trail. — I — IL 3:51–3:57.
55. [T] Trail → High street. — I — IL 4:00–4:02.

**Otis #2 (cake, file)**

56. [T] High street → Jail. — I — IL 4:05–4:07.
57. [A] Give breath mints to prisoner. Dia: 2 (G19; AG says either of the
    bottom two options). — I — G19, AG; IL 4:07 ("Give breath mints to"). The
    mints stay in the inventory and are reused in Part II (G19).
58. [A] Give gopher repellent to prisoner. Otis gives the **cake**. — I — G19,
    AG, WIKI; IL 4:12–4:14.
59. [A] Open cake, which gives the **file**. It can be done in the jail or
    while walking. — I — G19 ("Leave, Open cake"), AG; IL 4:15 (Guybrush finds
    the file).
60. [T] Jail → High street. — I — IL 4:16–4:17.

**Mansion #2 (idol)**

61. [T] High street → Trail. — I — IL 4:17–4:18.
62. [T] Trail → Mansion exterior. — I — IL 4:24–4:27.
63. [T] Mansion exterior → Mansion interior (no Open needed; "Walk to door" at
    IL 4:28). — I — IL 4:28–4:30.
64. [A] Walk to gaping hole. A cutscene follows: the file is used
    automatically and Guybrush takes the idol. Fester and the Governor talk to
    him. Dia: any (G19 lists one pick; AG says "any" for Fester and again for
    the Governor). Esc skips the rest. — I — G19, AG; IL 4:32 ("Walk to gaping
    hole"), 4:35 (fabulous idol in inventory), 4:39 (Fester).
65. [A] Open door (leave by the foyer door). Fester intercepts in a cutscene.
    Dia: any (AG; G19 just says skip). — I — G19 ("leave, SKIP Cutscenes"), AG;
    IL 4:42 ("Open door").
66. [S] Mansion interior → Pier (Fester cutscene) → Underwater. — I — AG; IL
    4:45–4:46. (2 scripted transitions.)
67. [A] Pick up idol (underwater). — I — G19 ("When you are underwater, Pick up
    Idol, SKIP"), AG; IL 4:46–4:47 (fabulous idol listed). **Idol trial done.**
68. [S] Underwater → Pier (Guybrush climbs out). — I — IL 4:52–4:53. (1
    scripted transition.)

**Swordfight interleave (both IL and WR)**

69. [T] Pier → Dock (walk left). — T — IL 4:53–4:55.
70. [T] Dock → Lookout. — T — IL 4:56–5:02.
71. [T] Lookout → Map. — T — IL 5:03–5:06.
    - SW detour, in human order:
      1. [T] Map → Bridge. The troll stops Guybrush.
      2. [A] Talk to troll, Dia: 1, 2, to learn the "dog" insult (G19, G-SW).
      3. [A] Give fish to troll (G19, AG; IL 5:12–5:24, WR 5:15–5:25).
      4. [T] Bridge → Map (IL 5:27).
      5. [T] Map → House (Smirk) (IL 5:28–5:33).
      6. [A] Open door (Smirk), Dia: 1, Esc, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, Esc. Pay **30**
         (computed money left: **172**) (G19, AG, WIKI; IL 5:33–5:45).
      7. [T] House → Map (IL 5:45–5:48).

      In the WR, a pirate intercepted Guybrush on the map at this point and
      the first insult fight happened before the dig (WR 5:55–6:30). In the IL
      the runner dodged a pirate on the map (IL 5:48–5:56).

**Treasure (forest dance)**

72. [T] Map → Fork. — T — IL 5:48–5:57; WR 6:32–6:33.
73. [T] Forest dance. Take these exits in order, starting on the Fork screen:
    **Back, Left, Right, Left, Right, Back, Right, Left, Back**. "Back" is the
    top exit. This is 9 transitions, and the first "Back" is Fork → Petal
    screen. You arrive in the X clearing, a wide room. — T
    - MAP gives the first word of each map line. MAP and my reading of the
      video cuts are the main support for 9 moves.
    - G19 lists **8** moves after "Enter Fork again": "Go left, Go Right, Go
      left, Go right, Go up, Go right, Go left, Go up", then "Go right and use
      shovel". These match the map's last 8 words. That G19's missing first
      "Back" is the Fork → Petal move is **inferred**; G19 does not say so.
    - IL 5:57–6:26 has 9 hard screen cuts (5:59.2, 6:02.9, 6:06.9, 6:10.5,
      6:14.0, 6:18.1, 6:21.2, 6:23.2, 6:26.3). Guybrush is seen exiting
      up/left/right/left at the first four and right/left/up at the last three.
      There is one extra black frame at 6:16.3, during Guybrush's "dancing
      lessons" line, with the same background before and after. I treat it as
      not a room change (inferred).
    - WR 6:33–7:01 shows the same pattern and the same line.
    - AG/JA and GW disagree; see §5.
74. [A] Walk right, then use shovel with X, which gives the **T-shirt**. — T —
    G19, AG, BMUG ("off to your right in the last scene"); IL 6:29 ("Use shovel
    with X"), 6:32 (T-shirt in inventory); WR 7:05. **Treasure trial done.**
    Both trials are complete at IL about 6:32 video time (about 6:28 run time).

**After the segment (not counted).** Walk left out of the X clearing to the
map ("Walk to forest path", IL 6:33). Then insult fights with roaming pirates.
After 3 wins, Carla, whose house G19 reaches from the Fork by: up, up, right,
right, left, up, use sign, right over log. Then the Part I crew phase (Stan,
mugs and grog for Otis, the safe or note of credit, Meathook, Carla).

## 4. Counts (treasure + idol only)

Counts follow the human route in its order, with the SW, CREW and Credit Early
steps removed. I did not reorder anything to find a shorter route.

### 4.1 Actions: 22

| # | Action | Step |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Open door (SCUMM Bar) | 2 |
| 2 | Open door (kitchen) | 5 |
| 3 | Pick up pot | 10 |
| 4 | Pick up hunk of meat | 11 |
| 5 | Give pot to Fettucini brothers | 20 |
| 6 | Pick up plants (yellow petal) | 25 |
| 7 | Use yellow petal with hunk of meat | 29 |
| 8 | Talk to Citizen of Mêlée | 31 |
| 9 | Talk to prisoner (Otis #1) | 39 |
| 10 | Open door (store) | 41 |
| 11 | Pick up shovel | 43 |
| 12 | Talk to storekeeper (mint + shovel) | 45 |
| 13 | Use meat with condiment with poodles | 49 |
| 14 | Open door (mansion) | 50 |
| 15 | Open door (foyer, right) | 52 |
| 16 | Give breath mints to prisoner | 57 |
| 17 | Give gopher repellent to prisoner | 58 |
| 18 | Open cake | 59 |
| 19 | Walk to gaping hole | 64 |
| 20 | Open door (leave mansion; Fester) | 65 |
| 21 | Pick up idol | 67 |
| 22 | Use shovel with X | 74 |

If G19's "Use pot on meat" is used, one pickup is saved, giving **21**.

Dialogue picks, not counted as actions:

| Conversation | Picks |
|---|---|
| Circus | 4 |
| Citizen | 2 |
| Otis #1 | 0 |
| Store, mint + shovel only | about 4 (inferred) |
| Otis #2 | 1 |
| Mansion (gaping hole) | 1–2 |
| Fester at the door | 0–1 |
| **Total** | **about 12–14** |

### 4.2 Room transitions

**48 player-initiated transitions from the Lookout:** steps 1, 3, 4, 6, 12–18,
21–24, 26–28, 30, 37, 38, 40, 42, 46–48, 51, 53–56, 60–63, 69–72, plus 9
inside step 73. **47** if the speedrun intro skip is used (step 1 is then not
needed).

Of these, **8 are island-map transitions** (steps 16, 17, 22, 23, 27, 28, 71,
72):

- Lookout → Map, twice
- Map → Clearing
- Clearing → Map
- Map → Fork, twice
- Fork → Map
- Map → Village

Plus **3 scripted transitions** (steps 66 and 68), not counted.

### 4.3 Excluded steps, listed separately

**Swordfight only:** 7 actions (8 if G19's two plank launches count
separately) and 4 transitions, plus 2 dialogue picks in the store conversation.

- Actions:
  - open the kitchen pier door
  - step on the plank (1 action; 2 if both launches count)
  - pick up fish
  - pick up sword
  - talk to troll
  - give fish to troll
  - open door at Smirk's
- Transitions:
  - Map → Bridge
  - Bridge → Map
  - Map → House
  - House → Map

  These replace nothing, because the treasure path goes Lookout → Map → Fork
  either way.

**Crew only (chicken):** 3 actions (open, pick up chicken, open) and 2
transitions (Low street ↔ Voodoo shop).

**Credit Early (WR only):** about 4 or more safe Pull/Push actions plus taking
the note, in the first store visit.

**Human route as run (IL, without Credit Early):**

- 22 + 7 + 3 = **32 actions** (33 with two plank actions)
- 48 + 4 + 2 = **54 transitions** from the Lookout (53 with the intro skip)

## 5. Open questions and uncertainties

1. **Forest dance directions.** Sources disagree.
   - MAP gives 9 first words: Back, L, R, L, R, Back, R, L, Back.
   - G19 lists only 8 moves after entering the Fork. They match the map's last
     8 words. That its missing first Back is the Fork → Petal move is
     inferred.
   - AG/JA give "take either exit at the top" plus L, R, L, R, U, R, L, U,
     **L, U** (11 moves).
   - GW (Special Edition) gives N, W, N, W, N, N, E, W, N, E.
   - IL and WR footage fits the 9-move reading, if the black frame during the
     "dancing lessons" line is not a room change. That interpretation is mine.

   I count 9, but this should be confirmed against the forest room scripts.
   Also unconfirmed: whether the forest checks for owning the map at all. G19
   implies the Sword Master path only works with the map. If the X is reachable
   without the map, a shortcut exists: skip the Citizen and save 100.
2. **Otis #1 (step 39).** G19 and both videos do it right before the store, but
   no source says why. My guess is that it unlocks the breath-mint option or
   Otis's mint dialogue. Verify in the scripts. If it is not needed, the count
   drops by 1 action and 2 transitions.
3. **Store dialogue numbers.** Only option 3 = mint was seen on screen (IL
   3:09). The meaning of the later 1, 1, 1, 1, 2 is inferred, and the
   shovel-only variant without the sword is not observed in any source.
4. **Is "Open door (kitchen)" (step 5) needed?** This is worth ±1 action.
   - AG enters without an action: it waits near the fireplace until the cook
     comes out on his own.
   - G19 says to open the door, and its notes say the cook leaves about 10 s
     after you "try to enter".
   - In the IL, the cook appears after a misclicked verb on the door and a
     generic failure line (0:21–0:27), not after a clean Open.

   So it is open whether the cook runs on a timer or is triggered by the
   attempt. I keep step 5 in the count (22). Check the bar and kitchen scripts.
5. **Plank launches (step 8).** G19 says 2, AG says 3. This is SW only, so it
   does not affect the counts.
6. **Mansion dialogue picks.** G19 lists one "any" pick plus skips. AG lists
   picks for Fester and the Governor, then Fester again at the door. The
   difference probably comes from Esc skipping; not verified.
7. **Room boundaries are partly inferred.**
   - That the mansion foyer and stair hall form one wide room comes from IL
     camera snaps.
   - So do the Pier as a separate room from the Dock, and the X clearing being
     wide (Fork-side undergrowth plus the sign).
   - The Petal → Fork return (step 26) is also inferred.

   CD (WR) scrolling was consistent with this. Script room numbers would
   settle it.
8. **Idol trial completion point.** I mark it at "Pick up idol" underwater
   (step 67). The trial flag may be set at pickup, at the climb out, or on
   returning to the Dock. This matters for a goal condition.
9. **Version.** Human evidence is DOS VGA floppy (IL), DOS CD (WR, G19) and EGA
   (HYP, comment only). fast-mi uses Mac v5 VGA. No differences in the Part I
   trial steps were seen between floppy and CD. Mac was not checked. The IL
   floppy inventory shows extra mansion items (staple remover, Manual of
   Style, wax lips); I did not check whether CD gives the same.
10. **Money.** 478 and 378 are seen in IL. The later balances (202 after the
   store, 172 after Smirk) are computed from WIKI prices, not observed.
   Treasure + idol needs only 176 (map 100 + shovel 75 + mints 1), so the
   circus is mandatory: the only other money source found, the Men of Low
   Moral Fiber (WIKI, AG), gives a coin or two. WIKI says the mints cost 1; AG
   says the storekeeper "will give" them.
11. **Not watched:** LeoLitz's YouTube video guide (named as the most
    up-to-date in F-CONV) and HYP's video. The route here comes from the
    2025–2026 dalek.zone videos plus G19, not from those.
